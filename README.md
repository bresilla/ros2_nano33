# ros2_nano33

## Overview

The `ros2_nano33` package reads data from a serial port connected to a sensor module (e.g., gyroscope, magnetometer, accelerometer) on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board and publishes the data to different ROS 2 topics. It also includes a node that subscribes to these topics and publishes the data as a `sensor_msgs/msg/Imu` message.

## Features

- Reads data from a serial port.
- Parses sensor data (gyroscope, magnetometer, accelerometer).
- Publishes parsed data to corresponding ROS 2 topics.
- Subscribes to sensor data topics and publishes `sensor_msgs/msg/Imu` messages.

## Topics

### Published Topics

- `/gyro` (`std_msgs/msg/Float32MultiArray`): Gyroscope data.
- `/mag` (`std_msgs/msg/Float32MultiArray`): Magnetometer data.
- `/acc` (`std_msgs/msg/Float32MultiArray`): Accelerometer data.
- `/imu` (`sensor_msgs/msg/Imu`): Combined IMU data.

### Subscribed Topics

- `/gyro` (`std_msgs/msg/Float32MultiArray`): Gyroscope data.
- `/mag` (`std_msgs/msg/Float32MultiArray`): Magnetometer data.
- `/acc` (`std_msgs/msg/Float32MultiArray`): Accelerometer data.

## Installation

1. **Install ROS 2**: Follow the instructions from the [official ROS 2 documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) to install ROS 2.

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libserial-dev
   ```

3. **Create a ROS 2 workspace** (if you don't have one already):
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   colcon build
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

4. **Clone the package** into your workspace:
   ```sh
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   git clone <repository_url> ros2_nano33
   ```

5. **Build the package**:
   ```sh
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   colcon build --packages-select ros2_nano33
   ```

6. **Source the workspace**:
   ```sh
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the sensor reader node**:
   ```sh
   ros2 run ros2_nano33 sensor_reader_node
   ```

2. **Run the IMU publisher node**:
   ```sh
   ros2 run ros2_nano33 imu_publisher_raw
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   ros2 run ros2_nano33 imu_publisher_euler
   ```

## Configuration

Update the serial port and baud rate in `sensor_reader_node.cpp` if needed or just jump to Sensor Reading part where you can find how to read the sensor data from the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board without super user permissions and create a symbolic link to the device file.

```cpp
std::string port = "/dev/ttyUSB0";  // Update with your serial port
unsigned long baud = 115200;        // Update with your baud rate
```

## Example Output

The `sensor_reader_node` reads lines like:
```
Gyroscope:      0.43    -0.06   -0.06
Magnetometer:   -74.00  0.00    58.00
Acceleration:   0.16    -0.10   0.99
```
and publishes the data to the corresponding topics.

The `imu_publisher_node` subscribes to the `/gyro`, `/mag`, and `/acc` topics, aggregates the sensor data, and publishes it as a `sensor_msgs/msg/Imu` message.


## Sensor reading

To read the sensor data from the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board without super user permissions, you can create a udev rule to create a symbolic link to the device file.


### 1. Identify the Device Attributes

First, connect your Arduino Nano 33 BLE to your computer and run the following command to list its attributes:

```bash
udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyACM0 --attribute-walk
```

Look for the attributes of the device, such as `idVendor`, `idProduct`, and `product`. For the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, these typically are:

```plaintext
ATTRS{idVendor}=="2341"
ATTRS{idProduct}=="805a"
ATTRS{product}=="Nano 33 BLE"
```

You can use this command to get those informations:

```bash
udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyACM0 | grep -E 'ID_VENDOR_ID|ID_MODEL_ID|ID_MODEL'
```

### 2. Create a Udev Rules File

Create a new udev rules file using the command:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-arduino-nano-33-ble.rules
```

### 3. Add the Udev Rule

Add the following line to the file to create a symbolic link `/dev/nano33ble`:

```plaintext
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2341", ATTRS{idProduct}=="805a", ATTRS{product}=="Nano 33 BLE", SYMLINK+="nano33ble", MODE="0666", GROUP="dialout"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### 4. Make user part of the dialout group

Add your user to the `dialout` group to access the serial port without super user permissions:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

### 5. Reload Udev Rules

Reload the udev rules to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

### 6. Verify the Symbolic Link

Unplug and reconnect your Arduino Nano 33 BLE, then verify that the symbolic link has been created:

```bash
ls -l /dev/nano33ble
```

You should see output indicating that the symbolic link points to the correct device file (e.g., `ttyACM0`).
